### Biases
ModelA: Assumes no bias among sides (e.g., a fair die)
ModelB/C: Assumes linearly-increasing dependence for higher values, which could be reasonable if dots are marked by heavy insets
For the second trial, the data are not consistent with any model, but of course we must consider which model they agree with the most/least. The results are opposite of models B and C, which have increasing $p(x)$ with increasing $x$, whereas modelA has a flat distribution. again, we conclude modelA represents the data best *of the given models*, but the level of disagreement warrants further model analysis.
